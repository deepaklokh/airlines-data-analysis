# Airlines Data Analysis Project

## Business Problem

Our company operates a diverse fleet of aircraft ranging from small business jets to medium-sized airliners. We have been committed to providing safe, comfortable, and convenient air transportation services to our clients for several years.

However, the company faces increasing challenges affecting profitability, including:
- Stricter environmental regulations increasing operating costs.
- Higher flight taxes imposed globally.
- Rising fuel prices and increased labor costs due to a tight labor market.
  
To maintain profitability, the company seeks to analyze its flight and booking data to identify strategies for increasing occupancy rates and optimizing revenue per seat.

## Main Challenges

1. **Stricter Environmental Regulations:** Growing demand to reduce the airline industryâ€™s carbon footprint has resulted in more stringent laws, driving up costs and limiting growth.
2. **Higher Flight Taxes:** Governments worldwide are increasing taxes on flights to address environmental issues and generate revenue, raising costs and reducing demand.
3. **Tight Labor Market:** A shortage of trained aviation personnel increases labor costs and turnover rates.

## Project Objectives

- **Increase Occupancy Rate:** Boost average profit earned per seat by increasing the percentage of seats filled on each flight.
- **Improve Pricing Strategy:** Develop adaptive pricing models that reflect market changes and customer preferences.
- **Enhance Customer Experience:** Deliver a seamless booking-to-arrival journey to increase customer loyalty and differentiate from competitors.

## Data Analysis Overview

### Aircraft Seating Capacity

The analysis focuses on aircraft with more than 100 seats:

| Aircraft Code | Number of Seats |
|---------------|-----------------|
| 319           | 116             |
| 320           | 140             |
| 321           | 170             |
| 733           | 130             |
| 763           | 222             |
| 773           | 402             |

### Ticket Booking and Revenue Trends

- Ticket bookings gradually increased from June 22 to July 7, stabilized through August, with a peak booking day noted.
- Revenue closely follows booking trends, suggesting ticket volume drives income.
- Further exploration of peak booking causes can inform strategies to maximize revenue.

### Pricing by Fare Class

- Fares are analyzed across Business, Economy, and Comfort classes (comfort only on aircraft 773).
- Business class fares consistently higher than economy across all aircraft.
- Some planes, like CN1 and CR2, offer only economy fares at lower prices, potentially impacting revenue.

### Occupancy and Revenue Insights

- Highest total revenue comes from aircraft SU9, which offers lower prices for business and economy fares, attracting more passengers.
- Lowest revenue is from aircraft CN1, offering only low-priced economy class, possibly due to poorer conditions or fewer amenities.
- Average occupancy rates calculated by dividing booked seats by total seats provide insights into seat utilization and profitability.

### Impact of Increasing Occupancy

- Modeling a 10% increase in occupancy across all aircraft shows a gradual increase in total revenue.
- Emphasizes the need for targeted pricing and marketing strategies to improve occupancy and profitability.

## Conclusions & Recommendations

- Analyzing total revenue, average ticket revenue, and occupancy rates per aircraft is essential for maximizing profitability.
- Adjust pricing strategies to better reflect aircraft condition and class offerings, avoiding prices that are too high or too low.
- Focus on increasing occupancy rates without compromising customer satisfaction or safety.
- Use data-driven approaches to balance profitability with high-quality service and regulatory compliance.
- Optimizing occupancy and pricing strategies will help sustain competitiveness and drive long-term success in the airline industry.
